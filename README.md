## Project description
The project looks at how storing renewable electricity affects its cost. When we use electricity directly from wind turbines or solar panels, the cost mainly comes from building and installing the equipment. But if the electricity is stored — for example, in batteries or by making hydrogen — extra costs are added for the storage equipment. The longer the electricity stays in storage, the more expensive it becomes.

This is important because renewable energy doesn’t always match when we need electricity. Storage helps make sure power is available when needed, but it comes at a price. Understanding this cost helps broaden our horizons and begs the question should we always match 100% of demand?

## Progress
### 7th of March
Intial verification and Monti Carlo simulation where demand is met 100%
Validation model approved intial result 
No round trip efficiency added for batteries
Only using storage as batteries

## Future approach
Focus on demand met per x hours to create a graphical result.
Clean and add validation model
Consider more detailed approach to storage (round trip efficiency/hydrogen) based on reseach
